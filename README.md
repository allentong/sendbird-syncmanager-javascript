# SendBird SyncManager for JavaScript

SyncManager for JavaScript is a SendBird SDK add-on for chat data synchronization that allows you to reliably cache group channels and messages in your JavaScript client app with minimal effort. When SyncManager is added to your client app, it listens to the events that happen in channels and messages in real-time and executes the background tasks to update the local cache with data queried from SendBird server.

## Build

```
~$ npm install `sendbird-syncmanager`
```

> Note: SyncManager requires `Node.js` v8.x+ installed to build.

## Documentation

See the [docs](https://docs.sendbird.com/javascript/sync_manager_getting_started) in official SendBird docs page.
